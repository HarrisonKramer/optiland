"""Huygens-Fresnel Point Spread Function (PSF) Module

This module provides functionality for simulating and analyzing the Point
Spread Function (PSF) of optical systems using the Huygens-Fresnel principle.
It includes capabilities for generating PSF for a given optical system.
Visualization and Strehl ratio calculation are primarily handled by the base
class. The PSF is normalized against the peak of an ideal diffraction-limited
system calculated using the same Huygens-Fresnel principle.

    Computes PSF by integrating contributions from point sources across the

    would be 100.0. This makes the Strehl ratio (peak of actual PSF / 100.0,
