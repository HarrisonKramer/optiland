"""MMDFT Point Spread Function (PSF) Module

This module provides functionality for simulating and analyzing the Point
Spread Function (PSF) of optical systems using the Matrix Multiply Discrete Fourier
Transform. It includes capabilities for generating a monochromatic PSF at a desired
image size and pixel pitch from given wavefront aberrations and calculating the
Strehl ratio. Visualization is handled by the base class.

    """Class representing the Matrix Multiply Discrete Fourier Transform (MMDFT) PSF.

    This class computes the PSF of an optical system by taking the Fourier
    Transform of the pupil function. It inherits common visualization and
    initialization functionalities from `BasePSF`.

    Args:
        optic (Optic): The optical system object, containing properties like
            paraxial data and surface information.
        field (tuple): The field point (e.g., (Hx, Hy) in normalized field
            coordinates) at which to compute the PSF.
        wavelength (str | float): The wavelength of light in micrometers. Can be
            'primary' or a float value.
        num_rays (int, optional): The number of rays used to sample the pupil
            plane along one dimension. The pupil will be a grid of
            `num_rays` x `num_rays`. Defaults to 128.
        image_size (int, optional): The size of the image plane, in pixels. If not
            specified, it is calculated based on `num_rays`.
        pixel_pitch (float, optional): The size of the pixels in the image plane. If
            not specified, it is calculated based on image_size.
        strategy (str): The calculation strategy to use. Supported options are
            "chief_ray", "centroid_sphere", and "best_fit_sphere".
            Defaults to "chief_ray".
        remove_tilt (bool): If True, removes tilt and piston from the OPD data.
            Defaults to False.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the strategy.

    Attributes:
        pupil (be.ndarray): A complex-valued pupil function based on the wavelength
            used in the `Wavefront` parent. The pupil is a 2D array.
        psf (be.ndarray): The computed Point Spread Function. This is a 2D
            array representing the intensity distribution in the image plane,
            normalized such that a diffraction-limited system has a peak of 100.
        image_size (int): The output size of the image after DFT calculation.
        pixel_pitch (float): The resolution of the image after DFT calculation.
        num_rays (int): The number of rays used to sample the pupil. This is
                        the `num_rays` passed during initialization and used
                        by `Wavefront` for generating OPD/intensity data.
