"""FFT Point Spread Function (PSF) Module

This module provides functionality for simulating and analyzing the Point
Spread Function (PSF) of optical systems using the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). It includes capabilities for generating PSF from given wavefront
aberrations and calculating the Strehl ratio. Visualization is handled by
the base class.

    """Class representing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) PSF.

    This class computes the PSF of an optical system by taking the Fourier
    Transform of the pupil function. It inherits common visualization and
    initialization functionalities from `BasePSF`.

    If no grid size is specified, OpticStudio's FFT PSF sampling behavior is
    emulated by scaling down the number of rays in the pupil and using a
    grid size of `num_rays * 2`.

    Args:
        optic (Optic): The optical system object, containing properties like
            paraxial data and surface information.
        field (tuple): The field point (e.g., (Hx, Hy) in normalized field
            coordinates) at which to compute the PSF.
        wavelength (float): The wavelength of light in micrometers.
        num_rays (int, optional): The number of rays used to sample the pupil
            plane along one dimension. The pupil will be a grid of
            `num_rays` x `num_rays`. Defaults to 128.
        grid_size (int, optional): The size of the grid used for FFT
            computation (includes zero-padding). This determines the
            resolution of the PSF. Defaults to 1024. If not specified,
            it is calculated based on `num_rays`.

    Attributes:
        pupils (list[be.ndarray]): A list of complex-valued pupil functions,
            one for each wavelength used in the `Wavefront` parent. Each pupil
            is a 2D array.
        psf (be.ndarray): The computed Point Spread Function. This is a 2D
            array representing the intensity distribution in the image plane,
            normalized such that a diffraction-limited system has a peak of 100.
        grid_size (int): The size of the grid used for FFT computation.
        num_rays (int): The number of rays used to sample the pupil. This is
                        the `num_rays` passed during initialization and used
                        by `Wavefront` for generating OPD/intensity data.
