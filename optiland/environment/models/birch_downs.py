"""Birch and Downs Air Refractive Index Model

This module provides a function to calculate the refractive index of air based on
the revised Edlén-style equation published by K. P. Birch and M. J. Downs in
1994. This model corrects and supersedes their previous 1993 paper.

The calculation is valid for standard air (N₂, O₂, Ar, CO₂) and can be
adjusted for varying temperature, pressure, humidity, and CO₂ concentration.

Example:
    >>> conditions = EnvironmentalConditions(
    ...     temperature=20.0,
    ...     pressure=101325.0,
    ...     relative_humidity=0.5,
    ...     co2_ppm=450.0
    ... )
    >>> n = refractive_index(wavelength_um=0.633, conditions=conditions)
    >>> print(f"Refractive index at 633 nm is {n:.8f}")
    Refractive index at 633 nm is 1.00027103
