"""Kohlrausch Air Refractive Index Model (Zemax Implementation).

This module provides a function to calculate the refractive index of air
according to the specific formula used by Zemax OpticStudio. This formula is
attributed to F. Kohlrausch, but the constants used are specific to the
Zemax implementation.

The model consists of a Sellmeier-type dispersion equation for a reference
condition and a linearized scaling factor to account for variations in
temperature and pressure. It is a model for dry air and does not explicitly
account for humidity or CO₂ variations.
