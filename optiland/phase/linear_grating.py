    """A linear grating phase profile.

    This profile defines a constant phase gradient across the surface,
    representing a simple transmission or reflection grating.

    The phase is defined as:
    φ(x, y) = K_x * x + K_y * y
    where (K_x, K_y) is the grating wavevector.

    The grating vector is defined by its magnitude |K| = 2π / period and its
    angle (theta) relative to the positive x-axis.
    K_x = (2π / period) * cos(angle)
    K_y = (2π / period) * sin(angle)

    Args:
        period (float): The spatial period of the grating in mm. Must be positive.
        angle (float, optional): The angle of the grating's wavevector
            (direction of phase gradient) in radians, measured
            counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis. Defaults to 0,
            which creates grooves parallel to the y-axis.
        order (int, optional): The diffraction order. Defaults to 1.
        efficiency (float, optional): The diffraction efficiency for the
            specified order, between 0 and 1. Defaults to 1.0.
