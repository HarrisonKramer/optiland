    """Huygens Modulation Transfer Function (HuygensMTF) class.

    This class calculates and visualizes the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)
    of an optic using a Point Spread Function (PSF) derived from the
    Huygens-Fresnel principle.

    Note: This class currently only supports the 'numpy' backend due to the
    underlying HuygensPSF implementation.

    Args:
        optic (Optic): The optic for which to calculate the MTF.
        fields (str or list, optional): The field coordinates for which to
            calculate the MTF. Defaults to 'all'.
        wavelength (str or float, optional): The wavelength of light to use
            for the MTF calculation. Defaults to 'primary'.
        num_rays (int, optional): The number of rays to use for the HuygensPSF
            calculation along one dimension of the pupil grid. Defaults to 128.
        image_size (int, optional): The size of the image grid for PSF
            calculation and subsequent MTF. Defaults to 128.
        max_freq (str or float, optional): The maximum frequency for the MTF
            calculation in cycles/mm. If 'cutoff', it's determined by the
            diffraction limit (1 / (lambda * FNO)). Defaults to 'cutoff'.

    Attributes:
        num_rays (int): The number of rays used for the PSF calculation.
        image_size (int): The size of the grid used for the PSF/MTF calculation.
        max_freq (float): The maximum frequency for the MTF calculation (cycles/mm).
        FNO (float): The F-number of the optic.
        psf_data (list): List of 2D PSF data arrays for each field.
        psf_instances (list): List of HuygensPSF instances for each field.
        mtf (list): List of MTF data ([tangential, sagittal]) for each field.
        freq (be.ndarray): Array of frequency points for the MTF curve (cycles/mm).
