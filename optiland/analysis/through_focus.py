class ThroughFocusAnalysis(ABC):
    """Base class for through-focus analysis.

    This class provides the basic framework for analyses that need to be
    performed over a range of focal planes. It handles the iteration through
    different focal positions and delegates the specific analysis at each
    position to subclasses.

    Args:
        optic (optiland.optic.Optic): The optical system to analyze.
        delta_focus (float, optional): The increment of focal shift in mm.
            Defaults to 0.1.
        num_steps (int, optional): The number of focal planes to analyze
            before and after the nominal focus. Defaults to 5.
        fields (list[tuple[float, float]] | str, optional): Fields for
            analysis. If "all", uses all fields from `optic.fields`.
            Otherwise, expects a list of field coordinates.
            Defaults to "all".
        wavelengths (list[float] | str, optional): Wavelengths for
            analysis. If "all", uses all wavelengths from
            `optic.wavelengths`. Otherwise, expects a list of
            wavelength values. Defaults to "all".

    Attributes:
        results (list): A list to store the results from the analysis performed
            at each focal plane. The structure of each item in the list is
            determined by the `_perform_analysis_at_focus` method of the
            subclass.
