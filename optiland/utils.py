    Algorithm:
        1. Retrieve the defined given wavelength and field coordinates.
        2. Determine the image-space refractive index 'n' at the given wavelength.
        3. Trace four marginal rays (top, bottom, left, right) at the pupil edges,
            as well as the chief ray.
        4. Compute the angle between each marginal ray and the chief ray.
        4. Calculate the average of the squared numerical apertures from all traced
            marginal rays.
