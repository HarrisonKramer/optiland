    # The first material in the list is for the object space.

    # The space between s_i and s_{i+1} has material materials[i].
    # The material *into which* light refracts at s_i is materials[i+1].
    
    # Let's re-think the simple thin lens for Optic structure:
    # Obj (in Air) -> Lens Surface (in Air, but has power) -> Image (in Air)
    # Material list: [air, air]
    # Surface list: [obj_surf, lens_surf, img_surf]
    # obj_surf material is air. thickness to lens_surf is large (e.g. 1e9 or inf handled by object_at_infinity)
    # lens_surf material is air. thickness to img_surf is focal_length.
    # This means the lens surface itself provides the power, without a change in refractive index *after* it for propagation.
    # This is how thin lenses are often modelled if power is directly assigned or curvature acts in current medium.
    # In Optic, refraction occurs from material[i] to material[i+1] at surface[i].
    # So, a thin lens with n_lens=1.5 in air (n_air=1.0) needs:
    # Air -> Surface1 (curvature c1) -> Glass -> Surface2 (curvature c2, thickness t_lens) -> Air -> Image
    # Power P = (n_g - n_a)*c1 + (n_a - n_g)*c2  (approx, ignoring t_lens for thin lens)
    # If R1 is front surface, R2 is back surface: P = (n_g-1)/R1 + (1-n_g)/R2 = (n_g-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)
    # For a single surface providing power and then propagating to focus in same medium (air):
    # This is more like a Fresnel lens or a surface with magical properties.
    # Let's stick to a bi-convex lens with n=1.5, simplified to one surface for power.
    # Power P = 1/f. For one surface: P = (n_after - n_before) * c.
    # If lens is in air (n_before=1), made of glass (n_lens=1.5), then light enters glass.
    # So, n_after = 1.5. c_front = P_front / (1.5 - 1.0).
    # Then light exits glass. n_before_exit = 1.5, n_after_exit = 1.0.
    # c_back = P_back / (1.0 - 1.5).
    # For simplicity, let's assume the `StandardSurface` with `IdealMaterial` glass
    # implicitly handles the refraction from the *previous* material (air) into glass,
    # and its curvature acts on this. The `thickness` is then in glass.
    # Then we need another surface to exit glass into air.

    # Obj (air) --thickness_obj_to_lens1--> Lens1 (front, R1, into glass) --lens_thickness--> Lens2 (back, R2, into air) --dist_to_image--> Image
    
    # Let's use the provided example structure from other tests if available, or a very simple single powered surface.
    # The simplest is an object surface, one powered surface, and an image surface.
    # The powered surface will be in 'air' and its thickness will be 'focal_length' in 'air'.
    # This means the surface itself imparts the required phase change.

    object_s = ObjectSurface(name="object", material=air, geometry=Plane()) # Object at inf by default if first surface

    # For a thin lens in air, power P = 1/f.
    # If this power is achieved by a single surface, P = (n' - n) * C.
    # If we model the lens as existing in air (n=1, n'=1), then C must be infinite unless P=0.
    # This implies we must model the material change.

    # Surface 2: Lens back. Material before is Glass. Material after is Air. Curvature C2. Thickness T_to_image.

    # Let's use equal convex-convex radii for simplicity. P_total = P1 + P2.
    # P1 = (n_g - n_a) / R; P2 = (n_a - n_g) / (-R) = (n_g - n_a) / R.
