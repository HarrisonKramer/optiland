Geometries
==========

This section describes the geometry modules in Optiland. Geometries define the shape of an optical surface
and its position and orientation in space. Optiland provides a variety of geometry types, as well as a means to
build new geometry types by subclassing either the `BaseGeometry` class or the `NewtonRaphsonGeometry` class.
The former is used for geometries that can be described by a closed-form equation, while the latter is used for geometries
that require a numerical solution to find the intersection point with a ray.
