Real-World Projects
===================

This section showcases how Optiland can be used to design and analyze practical optical systems built
entirely from off-the-shelf components. Each example focuses on a real-world setup using catalog
lenses from suppliers like [Thorlabs](https://www.thorlabs.com/) or [Edmund Optics](https://www.edmundoptics.com/).
These projects highlight Optilandâ€™s potential not just as a simulation tool, but as a hands-on design
aid for teaching, prototyping, and experimentation.
