Real-World Projects
===================

This section showcases how Optiland can be used to design and analyze practical optical systems built
entirely from off-the-shelf components. Each example focuses on a real-world setup using catalog
lenses from suppliers like `Thorlabs <https://www.thorlabs.com/>`__ or `Edmund Optics <https://www.edmundoptics.com/>`__.
These projects highlight Optiland’s potential not just as a simulation tool, but as a hands-on design
aid for teaching, prototyping, and experimentation.
