Differentiable Ray Tracing
==========================

These examples demonstrate the use of differentiable ray tracing in **Optiland** using PyTorch as a computational backend. Differentiable ray
tracing allows for the computation of gradients with respect to various parameters in optical systems,
enabling advanced optimization techniques and sensitivity analysis.
