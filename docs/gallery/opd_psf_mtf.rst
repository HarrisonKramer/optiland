=================

This section contains examples of the analysis of the optical path difference (OPD), point spread function (PSF), and modulation transfer function (MTF) of an optical system. These examples are intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. For a complete list of available functions and classes, please refer to the `Optiland` API.
