Diffractive Systems
===================

This section contains examples of optical systems that utilize diffraction gratings, including spectrometer designs. These examples demonstrate grating parameter specification and wavelength dispersion modeling. These examples are intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. For a complete list of available functions and classes, please refer to the `Optiland` API.
