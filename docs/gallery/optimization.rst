Optimization
============

Optiland supports optimization through different backends.  
The **NumPy backend** relies on SciPy optimizers, while the **Torch backend**  
uses PyTorch’s native optimization tools.  

NumPy (SciPy) Optimization
--------------------------

These examples show how Optiland integrates with SciPy’s optimizers  
to improve optical systems using classical numerical methods.

Torch Optimization
------------------

These examples demonstrate optimization using the Torch backend,  
taking advantage of PyTorch’s autograd and optimizers for differentiable design.
