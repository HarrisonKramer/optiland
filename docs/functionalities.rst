Functionalities
===============

Optiland offers a powerful and extensible platform for the design, analysis, and optimization of optical systems. With a fully differentiable architecture and high-performance backend support, it is suitable for both classical optical engineering and modern machine learning applications. Below is an overview of its main capabilities.

Design Tools
------------

- **Differentiable and Backend-Configurable Architecture**:
  Optiland supports both NumPy and PyTorch backends for all core computations. This flexibility enables easy integration with scientific computing pipelines and deep learning frameworks.
- **Sequential Ray Tracing**:
  Trace rays through traditional or advanced systems, including asymmetric and freeform designs.
- **Lens System Modeling**:
  Built-in support for spherical, conic, aspheric, and fully freeform surfaces.
- **Aperture, Field, and Wavelength Configuration**:
  Configure optical systems for diverse apertures, fields, and wavelengths.

Analysis Tools
--------------

- **Real and Paraxial Ray Tracing**:
  Perform precise ray-based evaluations for both idealized and physically realistic systems.
- **Polarization Ray Tracing**:
  Model vectorial light propagation, including polarization effects and birefringent materials.
- **Comprehensive Optical Analysis**:
  Generate spot diagrams, ray aberration fans, OPD maps, distortion plots, and more.
- **Wavefront Analysis**:
  Decompose wavefronts into Zernike polynomials, compute RMS/peak error, and visualize wavefront error maps.
- **PSF and MTF Computation**:
  Evaluate image quality and spatial frequency response in imaging systems.
- **BSDF and Scattering Models**:
  Simulate surface scattering using measured or analytical BSDF models.

Optimization and Tolerancing
----------------------------

- **Flexible Optimization Framework**:
  Includes gradient-based solvers, global search algorithms, and support for automatic differentiation.
- **Operand-Based Merit Function Design**:
  Define custom merit functions using symbolic operands, easily extended with user-defined metrics.
- **Tolerancing and Sensitivity Analysis**:
  Perform Monte Carlo simulations and parametric sweeps to assess manufacturability and robustness.
- **Extensible Framework**:
  Add new optimization variables, constraints, or algorithms with minimal overhead.

Material Database
-----------------

- **Integrated Refractive Index Library**:
  Access data from refractiveindex.info directly within the package.
- **User-Defined Materials**:
  Create and register new materials with custom dispersion models.

Visualization
-------------

- **2D and 3D Visualization**:
  Plot optical layouts, surface properties, and ray traces using matplotlib (2D) and VTK (3D).
- **Interactive Debugging Tools**:
  Inspect and interact with optical systems for rapid prototyping and analysis.

Interoperability and Scripting
------------------------------

- **Zemax File Support**:
  Import and adapt existing designs from Zemax for further development or analysis.
- **JSON-Based I/O**:
  Save and load optical systems in a human-readable JSON format.
- **Python API**:
  Build and control optical systems programmatically for scripting, automation, and integration.

Performance
-----------

- **High-Speed Ray Tracing**:
  Optiland achieves real-time performance on modern hardware, with ray tracing speeds of (approx.):
  
  - **150–200 million ray surfaces per second** or more using the PyTorch backend on GPU.
  - **5–10 million ray surfaces per second** on CPU with the NumPy backend.

- **GPU Acceleration**:
  The PyTorch backend enables seamless GPU acceleration via PyTorch.
- **ML/DL Integration**:
  The differentiable PyTorch backend makes Optiland compatible with deep learning pipelines and allows gradient-based optimization of optical systems within broader ML frameworks.
- **JIT Compilation with Numba**:
  The NumPy backend uses Numba where appropriate to speed up CPU-bound calculations.
