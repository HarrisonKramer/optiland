## Introduction

**Optiland** is an open-source optical design platform built in Python, tailored for both classical lens systems and modern computational optics. It provides a robust and extensible interface for constructing, optimizing and analyzing optical systems, from standard refractive or reflective layouts to advanced freeform assemblies.

Built for professional engineering workflows, Optiland includes full support for tolerancing, high-performance optimization routines, and intelligent material selection through its integrated GlassExpert module. Also, traditional ray-based analysis are complemented by differentiable modeling support through PyTorch.

Whether you're developing prototypes in research or refining production systems, Optiland delivers the flexibility and precision needed to model, simulate, and optimize real-world optical instruments:

- ‚öôÔ∏è Build reractive and reflective systems using a clean, object-oriented API  
- üîç Trace rays through multi-surface optical assemblies, including aspherics and freeforms
- üìä Analyze paraxial properties, wavefront errors, PSFs/MTFs, and scatter behavior 
- üß† Optimize via traditional merit functions or autograd-enabled differentiable backends  
- üé® Visualize interactively in 2D (Matplotlib) and 3D (VTK).

Under the hood, Optiland uses NumPy for fast CPU calculations and PyTorch for GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation. Switch between engines depending on your use case with the same interface.

## Installation

- **Core only**

    ```bash
    pip install optiland
    ```

- **Core + GUI**

    ```bash
    pip install optiland[gui]
